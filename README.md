# RummikubChecker
A Python implementation of a checking algorithm for random set of Rummikub pieces


======= Description of Problem:

Input: a list of simple Rummikub tiles.
Output: True if the list can be broken down into valid combinations without any pieces left out, False otherwise

== Rummikub pieces:

Each Rummikub piece consists of two pieces of information: 
- A number, between 1 and 13.
- A color, between red, blue, yellow, and black.

Each piece is represented by an ordered pair (number, color) in the program.
